# Zine Platform
> A zine (short for magazine) is a small, self-published booklet, often photocopied, that is created by an individual or small group to share information or creative content
This project will be a platform for users to take their zines  that they've created, be able to upload them, and make them available for sale. Standard users will be able to read through these zines (maybe at some point some reading will require a subscription... todo etc)
